The Project Jupyter devs want to make the tools and techniques of data science available to all. In this vein, a long running goal of the JupyterLab team has been to make our frontend accessible for people with disabilities. Unfortunately, this goal has gone long unfullfilled. Currently, our frontend is almost completely useless for those with visual or motor impairments.

To fix this, the recently formed Jupyter Accessibility Working Group has launched a new project-wide development initiative, with the aim of bringing full accessibility to JupyterLab by the time v4.0 launches (end of year 2021). Our initial target is to refactor the existing JupyterLab UI in order to ensure that it is structured and labeled according to the WCAG2.1 standard (https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/).

In this talk we would like to share our progress towards the goal of a fully accessible JuptyerLab, the tools and resources available for accessibility development in general, and some of the pitfalls and blockers we have run into along the way.

The Jupyter Accessibility Working Group meets every other Wednesday at 1:15 PM ET. All are welcome, minutes can be found here: https://hackmd.io/WnaWXboXSiGoqWvev_fAvA
