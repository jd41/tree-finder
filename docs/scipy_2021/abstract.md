The Project Jupyter devs want to make the tools and techniques of data science available to all. In this vein, a long running goal of the JupyterLab team has been to make our frontend accessible for people with disabilities. Unfortunately, this goal has gone long unfullfilled. Currently, our frontend is almost completely useless for those with visual or motor impairments.

To fix this, the recently formed Jupyter Accessibility Working Group has launched a new project-wide development initiative, with the aim of bringing full accessibility to JupyterLab by the time v4.0 launches (end of year 2021). Our initial target is to refactor the existing JupyterLab UI in order to ensure that it is structured and labeled according to the WCAG2.1 standard (https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/).

In this talk we would like to share our progress towards the goal of a fully accessible JuptyerLab, the tools and resources available for accessibility development in general, and some of the pitfalls and blockers we have run into along the way.

The Jupyter Accessibility Working Group meets every other Wednesday at 1:15 PM ET. All are welcome, minutes can be found here: https://hackmd.io/WnaWXboXSiGoqWvev_fAvA










My talk will go over the  challenges I will discuss some of the process details

To make this happen, we are taking both a top-down and a bottom-up approach:

- top-down: JAWG's initial target will be to refactor the existing JupyterLab UI

Our work is proceeding along both a high-level

Acheiving accessibility will ultimately mean  UI and its UI is constructed from the same DOM nodes as any website. Ultimating, To accomplish this ambitious goal, My talk will describe

I will begin In the past, there have been several initiatives to bring accesibility I will begin by giving a brief account of the history of accessibility work in our project, and go over some of the challenges and stumbling-blocks that we have encountered along the way. I will then talk
